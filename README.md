# Linear_Regression

This project aims to demonstrate my understanding of how machine learning models perform linear regression to analyze relationships between two variables. The project will explore key concepts such as slope, intercept, residuals, and the method of least squares, showing how the model minimizes prediction errors to find the optimal linear relationship.
